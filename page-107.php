					The Internal Relations (IR) committee is one of the supporting committees of WSC, in charge of organising large-scale charity and bonding events for the club. The portfolio organises 3 main events yearly, namely WSC Bonding Day, WSC Community Service Day as well as the Annual Appreciation Dinner, which provide wonderful opportunities for members from the various portfolios in WSC to know each other better and develop friendships while having great fun. Prospective members will be able to try their hand in a multitude of event planning roles and will gain invaluable experience in tackling future demands.

					The Finance Committee manages the allocated budget from the Finance Office across all portfolios within WSC. Our support in the financial aspect of each portfolioâ€™s operations enables them to focus on and achieve their respective objectives and goals.
Active liaising with all portfolios and the Finance Office, our role is paramount in ensuring that all portfolios remain financially healthy at all times by monitoring expenditures, incomes and reporting any variances, as well as facilitating financial procedures on claims, donations and remunerations through active liaison with all portfolios and the Finance Office.

					Established in 2011, Growth & Opportunities! (GO!) is a vibrant and dynamic committee that focuses on social-entrepreneurial and developmental projects of WSC. As the exploratory arm of WSC, besides actively seeking sponsorship to support our volunteering activities, we also explore new avenues of growth by spearheading new social initiatives every year to further develop WSC's capabilities, and organise annual events such as Social Impact Week.

The three key objectives of GO! are to:
1. Spread awareness of social causes and promote spirit of volunteerism to NTU student population.
2. Explore new opportunities for WSC to grow / Support new causes outside the current boundaries of WSC.
3. Facilitate collaborations with other organisations and clubs within and outside of NTU.
