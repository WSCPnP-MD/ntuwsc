						Established in 2002, RSP (Visually Handicapped) seeks to reach out to the Visually Handicapped community through our collaboration with the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH). We focus on giving aid and befriending Visually Handicapped beneficiaries of all ages and motivating them to excel in their pursuits. We provide tuition services and conversational language classes for our beneficiaries from all walks of life, during our regular sessions, to empower and instill confidence in them. We also hope to create lasting and wonderful memories with them, through special events such as Eye Am Aware, as well as celebrations.

					​Regular Service Project for the Physically Challenged (RSP PC) is a project under Welfare Services Club which visions a society without discrimination towards the physically challenged. Our mission is to bridge the existing gap between society and the physically challenged community, allowing them to be A PART of society and not APART from society.

RSP (PC) hosts weekly sessions that alternate between the Singapore Cheshire Home and Friends of the Disabled Society (FDS). We hope to empower our physically challenged beneficiaries and assist their integration into society, as well as increase the public's understanding towards the physically challenged community in Singapore, through our activities and outings.

					Regular Service Project for the Mental Health (MH) is the latest addition to WSC in 2017 which aims to create greater awareness of our beneficiaries and to help students understand them better. By interacting with them weekly, students may forge a bond with the beneficiaries, allowing the beneficiaries to be part of a greater community.

We hope that these interactions will help the beneficiaries to feel closer and reconnect to the society at the same time. The activities we carry out, are also targeted at helping to keep them active mentally and physically, while learning new skills and improving themselves.

Apart from weekly sessions at IMH every Saturday, which comprise of activities such as handicraft making and games, are held every Saturday, from 3pm to 5pm, at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). The session comprises of befriending, handicrafts making, games and event celebrations such as Chinese New Year and Christmas Day.

Established in 1985, Regular Service Project for the Intellectually Disabled (RSPID) was the first RSP of NTU Welfare Services Club. We aim to impart useful social skills and ethics to beneficiaries, and expose them to the ever-changing environment, through the enriching programmes and outings we organise. Ultimately, we hope to help our beneficiaries integrate into society, gain employment, and feel a stronger sense of belonging to the society.						<br><br>

					Established in July 1991, RSP (Deaf Community) has been actively working towards raising awareness about the Deaf community and connecting with them. We hope to empower the Deaf community through regular activities such as sports and arts. We also provide weekly tuition services for children with hearing loss and for children of deaf adults (CODA). In addition to our regular sessions, we organise annual public events, such as Hi!Singapore and Christmas Song Sign, which aim to bring about greater appreciation and understanding of the Deaf community in society. Above all, we hope to connect with those we serve and to bridge the gap between them and the society at large.

					RSP (Youth) was set up in 1996 to provide an avenue for undergraduates in NTU to befriend and help youth-at-risk and underprivileged youth, by collaborating with various service organisations (Ministry of Social and Family Development, Singapore Girls’ Home, etc.) to engage and inspire teenagers to be better people. RSP (Youth) also helps spur underprivileged youth via academic support and other activities.
<br>
The objective of RSP (Youth) is to be "A Friend, A Mentor, A Teacher" to the youths we interact with by giving them support.

					"Friends of Children" (FoC) is a Regular Service Project which had started off as a special project under Elders in 2002, before branching out as a separate Regular Service Project in 2006. We mainly provide free academic coaching, mentoring and life-skills teaching to children from low-income families on a weekly basis. Apart from the weekly mentoring, our portfolio also organises events, whereby we may impart life skills to our beneficiaries. We organise two main events annually– namely the December and June Events– to encourage interaction between all the beneficiaries and volunteers from all centres.

					RSP (Elders) was set up in July 1992, to meet the increasing demand for volunteers to interact with the senior citizens in our society. RSP (Elders) volunteers are a constant source of care and companionship for the elderly beneficiaries on a long-term basis. We actively seek to understand the biopsychosocial needs of the elderly, and aim to alleviate their loneliness and boredom by befriending and organising activities for them. Regular sessions are conducted every Saturday at our centres located at Ang Mo Kio (AWWA Home), Novena (Ren Ci Community Hospital), and Sembawang (SWAMI Home). Help us in bridging the generation gap between the young and the old, and make society one in which the elderly feel they are a part of.

					Regular Service Project Operation Hope, (RSP OH) was formerly known as Operation Hope where it was co-opted by WSC under Special Projects (SP).

 

Our key objectives of this portfolio are to:

​

(1) reach out and connect with children and youths suffering from chronic and potentially life-threatening diseases and

(2) raise awareness of the plight of the beneficiaries.

 

From a portfolio which focuses on conducting one-off events for the beneficiaries, OH decided to rebrand and transit into an RSP in 2017, in order to make greater and longer-lasting impacts in the beneficiaries’ lives.
RSP (OH) currently works with various organisations to engage their volunteers in fun and meaningful activities during weekly volunteering sessions. We also hold annual events, which involves outdoor engagement or performance for the beneficiaries to enjoy a day-off outside of the designated centres.
