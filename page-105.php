					Targeting mainly non-WSC members, Volunteer Management (VM) aims to spread the spirit of volunteerism among students of NTU, through organising various events which involve beneficiaries from different community groups. By providing an easily accessible platform for meaningful interaction between the beneficiaries and the new student volunteers, we hope to ignite students’ passion for volunteerism and create a ripple effect, encouraging more students to share the joy of giving. In addition, VM hopes to raise awareness and understanding of different groups of beneficiaries, within NTU.
<br><br>
Come join us in planning events, and gain new experiences by interacting with different beneficiaries and student volunteers!

					​Ignite Change (IGC) is WSC's annual Freshmen Orientation Programme (FOP). We aim to foster bonds amongst the participants and ignite the spirit of volunteerism in potential volunteers. Throughout the duration of the camp, aside from enjoying the fun and exciting games planned by our main committee, participants will get to visit WSC's various Regular Service Projects (RSPs), to experience volunteering and also, interact with the beneficiaries that WSC works closely with.
Nothing is more fulfilling than planning a big event for a year and seeing it come to fruition and inspire benevolent change to the surroundings. You can expect exhilarating bonding sessions, heart-warming RSP visits, and that sense of purpose which accompanies meaningful work. We ignite change not just in potential volunteers, but also in you!

					Founded in 2002, Challenge ur Limits (CurL) is a special project, which organises events that allow beneficiaries with various special needs, student volunteers and members of the public to participate in physically and mentally challenging activities together. We aim to increase awareness of people with disabilities through promoting interaction between the beneficiaries and the public, and encourage society to look beyond beneficiaries’ disabilities, to see their spirit, determination and passion for life, and that they are able to also do their part for society. We hope that our events can lay the seeds of a more inclusive community, in which people will have a better understanding of the disabled. In short, CurL hopes to bring across the message that “Disability should never be equated to Disqualification”.

					Camp OutReach (COR), one of WSC's Special Projects, works closely with the Deaf community in Singapore. COR's core belief is that Deafness does not limit one’s capabilities or potential, and thus, our aim is to empower the Deaf by providing them with opportunities to contribute back to society. We strive to achieve this through local volunteering sessions and an annual Overseas Community Involvement Program (OCIP), where COR members and Deaf volunteers work together to serve an overseas community in need. COR also aims to bridge the communication gap between the Deaf and the hearing, and to enable interaction and integration beyond spoken languages. Regardless of whether it is Sign Language, spoken English or a foreign mother tongue that we communicate through, we hope to ultimately be able to unite people together through empathy, in spite of our differences.

					Overseas Volunteering Expedition (OVE) aims to provide a suitable platform for individuals with the passion for volunteering, to help less-privileged communities beyond Singapore's shores. In addition to striving to achieve sustainability through projects that would empower communities in the long run, OVE hopes to promote the spirit of volunteerism by inspiring volunteers to continuously collaborate with local and international communities to effect greater change. Through establishing a close-knitted group of individuals with the common goal of serving those in need, OVE aims to nurture future leaders who can think critically about prevalent social issues and creatively design solutions to alleviate the situation. To date, OVE has extended its outreach to several countries, such as Cambodia, China, Laos, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.
